Training Shifumi dapp V1

# A basic approach

> We propose an implementation for only two players in order to simplify some algorithms.

The rule is simple. Each player chooses to `play` `stone`, `paper` or `scissor` and that's all! And when each player has played we can `conclude` the round.

For this purpose, we identify different sequence diagrams.

## Nominal sequence diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Player1
  participant SM
  participant Player2
  participant Sender
  Note left of Player1: Prepare action(stone|paper|scissor, secret)
  Note right of Player2: Prepare action(stone|paper|scissor, secret)
  Player1->>SM: action
  Player2->>SM: action
  Sender->>SM: conclude
```

## Prohibited sequences

### Cannot play twice

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Player1
  participant SM
  Note left of Player1: Prepare chest(stone|paper|scissor, secret)
  Player1->>SM: action
  Player1-xSM: action
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Player1
  participant SM
  participant Player2
  Note left of Player1: Prepare chest(stone|paper|scissor, secret)
  Player1->>SM: action
  Player2->>SM: action
  Player1-xSM: action
```

### Cannot conclude before the end of the game

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant SM
  participant Sender
  Sender-xSM: conclude
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Player1
  participant SM
  participant Sender
  Note left of Player1: Prepare chest(stone|paper|scissor, secret)
  Player1->>SM: action
  Sender-xSM: conclude
```

## Howto ?

The implementation can be done thanks to the proposed tests suite. 

```sh
training-shifumi ➤ cd v1
v1 ➤ make 
[Testing] test/t01_action.jsligo

Test failed with "Predicate checking if the action is paper"
Trace:
File "test/../lib/action.jsligo", line 12, characters 4-57:

make: *** [test/t01_action.dummy] Error 1
```

Open the file `lib/action.jsligo` and write the expected code and iterate.

- actions.jsligo

## Smart contract data types proposition

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Action <|-- RoundValue
    RoundValue <|-- Round
    Round <|-- Storage
    Player <|-- Round
    Player <|-- Storage

    class Action{
         type t
         paper : t
         stone : t
         scissor : t
         is_paper(t) bool
         is_stone(t) bool
         is_scissor(t) bool
    }
            
    class Player{
         type t
         player1 : t
         player2 : t
    }

    class RoundValue{
         type t
         is_waiting(t) bool
         is_played(t) bool
         play(t,Action.t) t
    }

    class Round{
         type t
         fresh_round :t
         get_round_value(t,Player.t) (RoundValue.t)
         play(t,Player.t,Action.t) t
    }

    class Storage{
         type t
         initial_storage t
         new_game(t) t
         get_player(t,Address.t) (option Player.t)
         get_current_round(t) (option Round.t)
         update_current_round(t,Round.t) (Storage.t)
    }
```

## Retrospective ...

The current implementation is quite easy and natural but is it a good solution?

In the `t05_shifumi.jsligo` add the following test:

````
const why_this_solution_is_not_a_good_one = () : unit => {
    const get_contract_address = (storage:Contract.Storage.t) : typed_address<Contract.parameter, Contract.Storage.t> => {
        const originated = Test.originate(Contract.main, storage, 0 as tez);
        return originated[0] as typed_address<Contract.parameter, Contract.Storage.t>;
    };

    const get_contract = (address:typed_address<Contract.parameter, Contract.Storage.t>) : contract<Contract.parameter> => {
        return Test.to_contract(address) as contract<Contract.parameter>; 
    };

    const contract_address = get_contract_address(Contract.Storage.initial_game(alice.address, bob.address));
    const contract = get_contract(contract_address);

    Test.set_source(alice.address);
    const material = Action.paper;
    const _ = Test.transfer_to_contract(contract, Play(material), 10 as tez);

    Test.log(Test.get_storage(contract_address));

}

const test_why_this_solution_is_not_a_good_one = why_this_solution_is_not_a_good_one ();
```
