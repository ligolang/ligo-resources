/*
    LIGO is strongly and statically typed. This means that the compiler checks 
    how your contract processes data, ensuring that each function's expectations 
    are met. If it passes the test, your contract will not fail at run-time due 
    to some inconsistent assumptions on your data. This is called type checking.

    In addition, LIGO types are built on top of Michelson's type system.
